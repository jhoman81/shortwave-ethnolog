# shortwave-ethnolog
---

Logging software for ethnographic research involving two-way shortwave radio. User can (or will eventually be able to) create time-stamped entries of shortwave communications with GPS-linked locations, languages of speakers, kinship and social relationships, themes, and other critical information. Currently very basic functionality but adding new features all the time.
